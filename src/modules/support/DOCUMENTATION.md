## 🔄 Reset Conversation Feature

### Overview
The reset conversation feature allows users to clear their chat history and start fresh with a new conversation. This is useful when users want to:
- Clear sensitive information from the chat
- Start over with a different topic
- Reset the conversation context
- Test the chatbot functionality

### How to Reset

Users can reset their chat conversation in two ways:

#### 1. Header Reset Button
- Click the rotate icon (🔄) in the chat header next to the minimize button
- A confirmation dialog will appear in the header area
- Choose "Reset" to confirm or "Cancel" to abort

#### 2. Quick Action Button
- Use the "🔄 Reset Conversation" quick action button (available in the initial state)
- This will immediately reset the conversation without additional confirmation

### Reset Behavior

When a conversation is reset:
1. **Message History**: All previous messages are cleared
2. **Welcome Message**: A fresh welcome message is displayed
3. **Quick Actions**: Quick action buttons become visible again
4. **Input Focus**: The input field is automatically focused for immediate use
5. **Session Continuity**: The same session ID is maintained for analytics

### Keyboard Support
- **Escape Key**: Cancel the reset confirmation dialog
- **Enter Key**: Confirm the reset when the confirmation dialog is active

### Technical Implementation

The reset functionality is implemented through:
- `resetSession()` method in ChatbotService
- Confirmation state management in ChatbotWidget
- Special handling of the reset quick action
- Proper cleanup of component state

This feature enhances user control and provides a clean slate for new conversations while maintaining the session context for analytics purposes.
