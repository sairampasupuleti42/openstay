  - Windows tile configuration
  - PWA-specific meta tags
  - Proper theme colors
  - Mobile-optimized viewport settings

## How It Works

### Installation Flow
1. User visits the app for the first time
2. Service worker registers automatically
3. Browser fires `beforeinstallprompt` event (if installable)
4. Install prompt appears (if conditions are met)
5. User can install or dismiss the prompt
6. If dismissed, prompt appears again after 24 hours
7. If permanently dismissed, prompt never shows again

### Offline Experience
1. Service worker caches critical resources during installation
2. Navigation requests are served from cache if network fails
3. Offline indicator shows when network is unavailable
4. Users can still browse cached content
5. Network requests are cached for future offline access

### Update Mechanism
1. New service worker version detected
2. Update notification appears to user
3. User clicks "Update Now"
4. Old service worker is replaced
5. Page refreshes with new version

## Installation States

The app handles three installation states:

1. **Not Installable**: Browser doesn't support PWA installation
2. **Installable**: Can be installed but hasn't been yet
3. **Installed**: Running as installed PWA

## Browser Support

### Full PWA Support
- Chrome 67+ (Android, Desktop)
- Edge 79+ (Desktop, Android)
- Samsung Internet 8+
- Firefox 75+ (limited)

### Partial Support (Service Worker only)
- Safari 11.1+ (iOS, macOS)
- Firefox 44+

### Installation Support
- Chrome/Edge: Full install prompt support
- Safari iOS: Add to Home Screen
- Safari macOS: Limited support

## Configuration Files

### `manifest.json`
- App metadata and configuration
- Icon definitions for all sizes
- Display mode and theme settings
- App shortcuts and screenshots

### `sw.js`
- Service worker implementation
- Caching strategies
- Background sync setup
- Push notification handling

### `browserconfig.xml`
- Windows tile configuration
- Microsoft-specific settings

## Testing PWA Features

### Local Testing
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open Chrome DevTools
# Go to Application tab
# Check Manifest, Service Workers, Storage sections
```

### Production Testing
```bash
# Build and serve
npm run build
npm run preview

# Test on mobile device for full PWA experience
```

### Lighthouse PWA Audit
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to Lighthouse tab
3. Run PWA audit
4. Check for 100% PWA score

## Performance Optimizations

### Code Splitting
- Vendor chunks separated by functionality
- Lazy loading for non-critical routes
- Dynamic imports for large components

### Asset Optimization
- Image compression with vite-plugin-imagemin
- Inline small assets (<4kb)
- Efficient bundling with Rollup

### Caching Strategy
- Static assets cached indefinitely
- API responses cached with TTL
- HTML pages cache-first with network fallback

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Background Sync**: Sync form submissions when back online
2. **Push Notifications**: Real-time notifications for bookings, messages
3. **App Shortcuts**: Quick access to key features
4. **Share Target**: Accept shares from other apps
5. **Periodic Background Sync**: Update content in background

### Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Offline Form Handling**: Queue form submissions when offline
2. **Advanced Caching**: Predictive prefetching based on user behavior
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track PWA metrics and usage
4. **A2HS Prompts**: Custom Add to Home Screen prompts for iOS
5. **Web Share API**: Native sharing integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Install prompt not showing:**
- Check browser support
- Ensure HTTPS (required for PWA)
- Verify manifest.json is valid
- Check service worker registration

**Service worker not updating:**
- Clear browser cache
- Unregister service worker in DevTools
- Check for console errors

**Icons not displaying:**
- Verify icon paths in manifest.json
- Ensure icons are accessible
- Check icon format (PNG recommended)

### Debug Tools
- Chrome DevTools Application tab
- Lighthouse PWA audit
- Workbox debugging tools
- Browser console for service worker logs

## Security Considerations

### HTTPS Requirement
- PWA features require secure context (HTTPS)
- Service workers only work over HTTPS
- Development localhost exempted

### Permissions
- Notification permission requested appropriately
- Storage usage monitored and managed
- No sensitive data in service worker cache

### Content Security Policy
- Service worker respects CSP headers
- Cached resources follow same-origin policy
- External resources properly validated

## Metrics to Monitor

### Installation Metrics
- Install prompt show rate
- Install acceptance rate
- Uninstall rate
- Daily/Monthly Active Users (PWA vs browser)

### Performance Metrics
- Cache hit rates
- Offline usage patterns
- Update adoption rates
- Loading performance improvements

### User Experience Metrics
- Time to first meaningful paint
- Offline functionality usage
- Push notification engagement
- App usage patterns (standalone mode)

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Development**: `npm run dev` - PWA features work in development
2. **Build**: `npm run build` - Creates production-ready PWA
3. **Test**: Open Chrome DevTools > Application > Manifest/Service Workers
4. **Deploy**: Deploy to HTTPS-enabled hosting
5. **Install**: Visit app in supported browser, look for install prompt

The PWA implementation provides a native app-like experience while maintaining web accessibility and discoverability.
